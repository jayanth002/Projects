# Analyzing Singapore MRT Breakdown Data

**Project Objective:**
The primary goal of this project was to conduct a comprehensive analysis of breakdown data from the Singapore Mass Rapid Transit (SMRT) system. The project aimed to identify patterns, root causes, and trends related to breakdowns, leading to actionable insights for improving system reliability and commuter experience.

**Data Collection and Preprocessing:**
Acquired historical breakdown data from the SMRT system, including information about train lines, stations, types of incidents, duration of breakdowns, and time of occurrence.
Cleaned and standardized the data to ensure consistency and accuracy. Dealt with missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies that could impact the analysis.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
Performed exploratory data analysis to gain insights into breakdown patterns. Visualized breakdown frequencies, duration distributions, and their relationships with factors such as time of day and day of the week.
Investigated correlations between breakdown occurrences and external factors such as weather conditions and special events.

**Root Cause Analysis:**
Identified common root causes of breakdowns, such as power failures, signaling issues, and track obstructions, using a combination of text mining techniques and manual categorization.
Conducted a deep dive into specific incidents to understand contributing factors and potential systemic weaknesses.

**Time-Series Analysis:**
Utilized time-series analysis to uncover long-term trends and seasonality in breakdown occurrences. Examined if there were specific periods or seasons when breakdowns were more frequent.

**Predictive Modeling:**
Developed a predictive model using machine learning algorithms to forecast breakdown occurrences based on historical data and external factors like maintenance schedules and public holidays.
Evaluated the model's performance using appropriate metrics and validated its accuracy for short-term predictions.

**Results and Recommendations:**
Identified specific train lines, stations, and times of the day that experienced higher breakdown frequencies. This insight informed targeted maintenance efforts.
Uncovered correlations between breakdowns and external factors, contributing to better incident preparedness during adverse conditions.
