# Data Extraction for State Courts using Python.

**Project Objective:**
The primary objective of this project was to automate the process of extracting and organizing legal case data from state court websites using Python. The project aimed to streamline the data collection process for legal research and analysis.

**Data Source:**
The project involved extracting case information, including court decisions, case numbers, parties involved, judges, dates, and legal citations, from multiple state court websites. These websites provided a valuable repository of legal precedents and rulings.

**Web Scraping and Automation:**
Utilized Python libraries such as Beautiful Soup and Requests to scrape and parse HTML data from state court websites.
Developed automated scripts that navigated through the court websites, extracted relevant case details, and saved the data in structured formats.

**Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**
Cleaned and standardized the extracted data to ensure consistency and accuracy.
Handled edge cases and variations in data formatting across different state court websites.

**Error Handling and Quality Control:**
Implemented error handling mechanisms to address potential issues arising from changes in website structure or data format.
Performed data validation checks to ensure accuracy and completeness of extracted information.

**Documentation and User Guide:**
Prepared clear and comprehensive documentation outlining the project's purpose, technical implementation, and usage instructions.

**Results and Impact:**
Successfully automated the data extraction process from multiple state court websites, significantly reducing the time and effort required for legal researchers to collect case information.
Enabled legal professionals to access a centralized database of case data, promoting efficient legal research and analysis.

In this information extraction research, a methodology using rule-based information extraction to identify and extract crime-related information from charge sheets was taken and applied. Textual patterns in charge sheets and the loose rules followed by authors when writing charge sheets were used to identify the various named entities and in turn, extract the values. Named entities extracted were descriptions of stolen or misappropriated items, the number or quantity of said items and their monetary value. 

Throughout the entire research, several challenges were encountered and had to be catered for. Some of these issues, as identified in the Issues and Challenges section, are inherent in the source data and cannot be rectified. Certain charge sheets were essentially scanned image files saved as PDF files; this resulted in a degradation of the integrity of the data as the PDF files could not be properly parsed. As documented, this would require active measures on the relevant parties to ensure high-quality PDF files are generated. 

In conclusion, rule-based information extraction methodology built on RegEx-pattern matching has the potential to correctly identify and extract key named entity values. However, it is also limited by textual patterns which might differ in charge sheets under different Penal Sections. The research study conducted, prove the viability of the method but only under limited circumstances. For a fully extensible and wide-ranging method to automate the extraction of information from charge sheets, the rule-based extraction methodology must be complemented by other methods and techniques. 

**PROBABLE FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS & ALTERNATIVES:**

The deployment and use of only RegEx in this research proved to be rather restrictive; in that, data extraction capabilities are bounded by the strengths of RegEx which are primarily centred on pattern matching (Varadarajan, Kasravi & Feldman, n.d.). In most scenarios, unstructured textual information does not follow a clear pattern. In addition, charge sheets are written by different individuals with no strict style or structure in place; this introduces additional complexities and patterns. Catering for all possible patterns might not be a scalable or ideal solution for large problem set containing numerous pattern possibilities. Thus, in view of the shortcomings in the ‘vanilla’ RegEx approach, some additional measures our team proposes to overcome the weaknesses of RegEx could be,
 
a.	Pre-processing and preparation of PDF charge sheets to address issues that could not be fixed via Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and/or OCR (such as eliminating the use of image as PDF, standardising the use of numbered/bulleted points for listing of multiple items) 
b.	incorporation of Name Entity Recognition (NER) features and libraries such as Stanford CoreNLP, SpaCy, or NLTK, to identify unusual patterns not easily matched by RegEx
c.	incorporation of Part-of-Speech (POS), a ML technique, coupled with RegEx as a hybrid solution to enhance the effectiveness and flexibility of pattern matching.
